# Hello Series
Hello, World! Additionally, a variety of classroom and technical hellos.

# Purpose (AP CSP Hello)
* Foundation in social media using Slack, Padlet and Zoom.
* Establishing (a digital) relationship with your Pair/Trio team member(s), project team, and teacher.
* Foundation in Python coding using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/login).
* Using and Understanding [AP CSP Course Requirements](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf)
* Installing future foundational technical tools for class, namely: IntelliJ IDE. GitHub Version Control.  
* Establishing assesment and grading practices. Learning about Sprints and Deliberables. 

## Project (ASCII/Unicode Art Project)
Read and review each Python file.
* Look closely at comments for exploration ideas 

Further explorations are required, you are to set some goals as a project team and get approval from teacher on your goals as you form a Project Plan.  Each Friday you will have a project deliverable.

Grading criteria is based on [AP Computer Science A Computational and Thinking Practices: Skills Page 16](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) (CaTP) and [21st century skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_skills).  Rubric is equally divided amongst the following.
* Program, Design, Logic, Implementation - CaTP 1, 2, 3: documentation of goals prior to implementaton, code meeting technical goals.
* Presentation, Testing - CaTP 4, 5: Evidence showing completenes.  ability to run, procedures or video showing how to run and execute, organization, comments, documentation
* 21st century skills, CaTP 6:  communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity
* Intangibles: participation, active learner, being proactive, genuine effort, positve attitude 
Note: Grading will be highly influenced by project team and individuals initial assesment.


## Overview of provided Code
Here is overview of files for "Monkey Jumpers" sample:
* Main.java: Menu for the project.  Start learning Python.
* Stringy.java: A playground file, no real structure.  This is used to learn about and how to print or output to console ASCII/Unicode/Other characters.
* Numby.java: Another playground file.  This is required file for student exploration.  Links are provided as a guid.
* Listy: Third playground file.  This file requires update by student to output some family and computer information.
* Loopy (Loopy): Learn some fundamentals of procedural programming.  This file stores "Monkey Jumper" data, loops through data, and outputs it to screen.
* Classy.java (Classy): Introduction to some of the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP).  This file stores "Monkey Jumper" data in an OOP paradigm.  This introduces students to a way of performing animation.

| Unit | Percentage | Hello Series usage |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Big Idea 1: Creative Computing | 10-13% | The comments of this project are full of exploration ideas, Zoom, Cavas and Slack will promote collaboration |
|  Big Idea 2: Data | 17-22% | Listy, Loopy, and Classy are programs that illustrate data use and extraction |
|  Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming | 30-35% | Main uses conditionals and recursion.  Loopy and Classy uses iteration. |
|  Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Network | 11-15% | Repl.it is a group of computer systems that provide our Python coding learning environment  |
|  Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing | 21-26% |  Distance Learning is made possible to us today via the impacts of computing |
