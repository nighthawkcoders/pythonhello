Playground code for Python strings

A string is a collection of one or more characters.

Strings can be put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote.

Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.

Assignment, add 5 things
  1. make a sentence with punctuation
  2. manipulate the sentence
  3. make other words or phrases from sentence
  4. ... you pick ...
  5. ... you pick ...
